# Traffic-Sign-Detection-And-Model-Comparison
This is our final year capstone project for NSU. The initial plan was to detect traffic signs from images and videos then classify it in 47 different classes and then compare between various models to determine which model performs better. We wanted to use minimum two and maximum three different models. We succeded in yolov5 and faster-RCNN. We tried implementing SSD object detection model but there was some critical issues which we couldn't solve. It was a great experiece.
